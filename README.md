# Frellwit's filter lists
Various filter lists for your adblock extension. 

## Available lists

#### Frellwits-Swedish-Filter.txt

A filter for uBlock Origin for regional Swedish ads, tracking, social media, annoyances, sponsored articles etc. This is Sweden's regional filter in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) (uBO) located in: **Dashboard -> 3rd party-filters -> Regions, language -> SWE: Frellwit's Swedish Filter**

uBO enables the region/language-filter that corresponds to the locale of your web browser. This means that **SWE: Frellwit's Swedish Filter** will be enabled by default if your browser has Swedish locale installed, and that you have to enable the filter manually as described above otherwise.

#### deviantJUNKfilter.txt

A filter for deviantart.com. Blocks over 1000 of users that upload junk or stuff in the wrong categories. (Warning: This list is highly personal and may not suit everyone.) ([Raw link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lassekongo83/Frellwits-filter-lists/master/deviantJUNKfilter.txt))
