# Frellwit's filter lists
Various filter lists for your adblock extension. 

### Available lists

**Frellwits-Swedish-Filter.txt** = A filter for uBlock Origin for regional Swedish ads, tracking, social media, annoyances, sponsored articles etc. This is the default regional filter for Swedish uBlock Origin users. For most Swedish users this list should already be activated by default. If not: Open the dashboard, go to **3rd party-filters**, and scroll down to **Regions, languages** to enable the **SWE: Frellwit's Swedish Filter.**

**deviantJUNKfilter.txt** = A filter for deviantart.com. Blocks over 1000 of users that upload junk or stuff in the wrong categories. (Warning: This list is highly personal and may not suit everyone.) ([Raw link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lassekongo83/Frellwits-filter-lists/master/deviantJUNKfilter.txt))
